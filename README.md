# Counting the Cycles of a Graph

## What is this?
This is a code that count how many cycles there's in a graph for 'Algoritmos em Grafos' for PUC Minas. Here, we have a graph (simple, non-directed and non-weighted) 'translated' in text form so the code can understand.

We used a graph implementation (see ``https://github.com/g1ovannab/graph-representation`` to know more), using an adjacency matrix for the computed representations of the graph.

We were asked to implement with two different solutions, as well as one based on the permutation of the graph~s vertices, and the other based on the graph~s walking.

## How the files will be organized
~~~txt 
1	90 				//number of vertices
2	120				//number of edges
3	1 2             //edges
4	2 3          
5	5 6
